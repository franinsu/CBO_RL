  abstract = 	 {We develop the method of stochastic modified equations (SME), in which stochastic gradient algorithms are approximated in the weak sense by continuous-time stochastic differential equations. We exploit the continuous formulation together with optimal control theory to derive novel adaptive hyper-parameter adjustment policies. Our algorithms have competitive performance with the added benefit of being robust to varying models and datasets. This provides a general methodology for the analysis and design of stochastic gradient algorithms.}
